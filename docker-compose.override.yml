## The following `version` and `services` keys must exist and they mush match the
##   keys used in your `docker-compose.yml` file.  All other lines, like the file
##   itself, are OPTIONAL.  However, if you remove ALL elements of a list you MUST
##   also remove (or comment out) the list's key.  See the 'live' examples below.
version: '3'
services:

  ## Overrides for the Portainer (isle-portainer) service.
  isle-portainer:
    ## The following line replaces the Portainer service `command` key with a password
    ##   for the 'admin' user to access the stack's Portainer service.
    ## See the 'Admin password' and 'Available flags' section of
    ##   https://portainer.readthedocs.io/en/stable/configuration.html.

  ## Note that the next section, `mysql`, is entirely commented out.  Since we've
  ##   removed (commented out) ALL of the elements of 'volumes:', it is
  ##   NECESSARY to comment out the 'volumes:' key too.  NEVER leave any list key
  ##   with an "empty" list!  Likewise, if you uncomment a list element (like
  ##   `- ./config...`), or add other values to list, be sure to also remove any
  ##   comment mark from the parent (volumes:) key.
